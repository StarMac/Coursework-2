# Coursework-2

My second-year Coursework

An explanation of the contents of the folders:

Builds - The folder where the already built project is located (run CourseWork.exe).

Course Work - The folder that contains absolutly all of the project files, including C# scripts, sprites, and other heavy assets.

All my code is in the Coursework-2/Course Work/Assets/Scripts/ directory.
